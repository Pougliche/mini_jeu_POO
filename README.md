App.rb -> 

This game will offer you to follow a fight between Spider-Man and one of his worst enemy, Green-Goblin. 

Launch the program and the fight happens, you can then look at the result in your terminal. Sit back and relax while reading about an epic fight between good and evil. Your brain will be needed to visualize the fight but hopefully Gwen Stacy will be alright !

App_2.rb ->

In this game, you will fight both Spider-Man and Green-Goblin with your own character. Hopefully, your spider-sense will be tingling and you'll end up winning against the odds.

First, name your character. You can choose anything, we trust you.

You will then be offered several options :
- Press "a" and search for a better weapon. If you don't find a better weapon than the one you already have, you will have lost a turn.
- Press "s" to look for healthpacks. If you don't find anything, you'll have lost a turn. Note that your health cannot be higher than 100HP.
- Press "0" to attack Spider-Man. Be careful of his webbing and quips
- Press "1" to attack Green-Goblin. His pumpkin bombs will laugh at you if you fail.

The game will end when the player's enemies have no health and are both defeated.
The player can also lose, so stay sharp and focused!
